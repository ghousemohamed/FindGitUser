Done to better understand state management in react using context API and hooks.

This project's main objective was to build a stronger foundation in 'state management'. This project more specifically 
tackles context API and hooks. 
Understanding on a under-the-hood level was the primary motive behind this project. Also understanding how context and hooks can aid in 
scaling an application and how it is different from Redux in its implementation.
The pros and cons of using Redux over Context or Context over Redux was explored by comparing performance of a similar redux based application I built with the github-finder.
